It is designed to be distributed and efficient with the following advantages:\n","\n","  - Faster training speed and higher efficiency.\n","  - Lower memory usage.\n","  - Better accuracy.\n","  - Support of parallel and GPU learning.\n","  - Capable of handling large-scale data.\n","  \n","  \n","- At present, decision tree based machine learning algorithms dominate Kaggle competitions. The winning solutions in these competitions have adopted an alogorithm called **XGBoost**. \n","\n","- A couple of years ago, Microsoft announced its gradient boosting framework LightGBM. Nowadays, it steals the spotlight in gradient boosting machines. Kagglers start to use LightGBM more than XGBoost. LightGBM is 6 times faster than XGBoost. \n","\n","- Light GBM is a relatively new algorithm and have long list of parameters given in the [LightGBM documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM),\n","\n","- The size of dataset is increasing rapidly. It is become very difficult for traditional data science algorithms to give accurate results. Light GBM is prefixed as **Light** because of its high speed. **Light GBM can handle the large size of data and takes lower memory to run**. \n","\n","- Another reason why Light GBM is so popular is because it focuses on accuracy of results. LGBM also supports GPU learning and thus data scientists are widely using LGBM for data science application development.\n","\n","- It is not advisable to use LGBM on small datasets. Light GBM is sensitive to overfitting and can easily overfit small data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZpSvFG6aDruS"},"source":["# **2.

The difference is in the order in which the tree is expanded. Since we don't normally grow trees to their full depth, order matters.\n","\n","- Application of early stopping criteria and pruning methods can result in very different trees. Because leaf-wise chooses splits based on their contribution to the global loss and not just the loss along a particular branch, it often (not always) will learn lower-error trees \"faster\" than level-wise. \n","\n","- For a small number of nodes, leaf-wise will probably out-perform level-wise. As we add more nodes, without stopping or pruning they will converge to the same performance because they will literally build the same tree eventually."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-onm2WrFDruc"},"source":["# **3.

But now it's been challenged by [LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM) — which runs even faster with comparable model accuracy and more hyperparameters for users to tune. \n","\n","- The key difference in speed is because **XGBoost split the tree nodes one level at a time** and **LightGBM does that one node at a time**.\n","\n","- So XGBoost developers later improved their algorithms to catch up with LightGBM, allowing users to also run XGBoost in split-by-leaf mode `(grow_policy = ‘lossguide’)`. Now XGBoost is much faster with this improvement, but LightGBM is still about 1.3X — 1.5X the speed of XGB. \n","\n","- Another difference between XGBoost and LightGBM is that XGBoost has a feature that LightGBM lacks — **monotonic constraint**.
